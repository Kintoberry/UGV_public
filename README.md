On Linux system, if you want to open a port to connect to the pixhawk 4 or the telemetry hardware,
you need to add your current user ($USER) to the `dialout` group:

> sudo adduser $USER dialout

For the change of your group to take effect, you need to restart the linux operating system.
To check if you are included in the group:

> id
groups=4(adm),20(dialout),24(cdrom),27(sudo),30(dip),46(plugdev),122(lpadmin),135(lxd),136(sambashare)

As you can see, the current user is in the group `dialout`.
